# CS2 Enemy Intelligence Overwolf App: 3-Agent Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive development plan restructures the CS2 enemy intelligence application into **three specialized GPT agents** working collaboratively to deliver a complete Overwolf-based solution. The streamlined approach enables parallel development while maintaining clear separation of concerns and efficient integration points.

The application will provide real-time enemy analysis through Steam ID extraction from CS2 game events, multi-platform data aggregation, AI-powered cheat assessment, and live economy tracking—all delivered through a responsive overlay interface during competitive matches[^1][^2][^3].

CS2 Enemy Intelligence App: Technical Architecture - Data flow and component integration between the 3 specialized GPT agents

## Technical Architecture and Data Flow

The application follows a **layered architecture** approach where CS2 game events flow through specialized processing layers before reaching the user interface. Overwolf's Game Events Provider (GEP) supplies real-time `kill_feed`, `roster_`, and `match_info` data that enables both Steam ID extraction and economic analysis[^2].

**Data Processing Pipeline**:

1. **Game Events Layer** - Overwolf captures CS2 match data including kill feed and player roster
2. **Economy Analysis** - Agent 1 processes weapon usage and round outcomes for money tracking
3. **External Data Enrichment** - Agent 2 fetches comprehensive player profiles from multiple APIs
4. **AI Assessment** - Perplexity API analyzes aggregated data for cheat probability scoring
5. **Integration \& Caching** - Agent 3 combines all data sources with intelligent caching
6. **UI Presentation** - Real-time overlay displays player cards and economy predictions

## Development Timeline and Milestones

The **15-day development cycle** supports parallel work streams while ensuring proper integration checkpoints:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)**

- Agent 1: CS2 economy rules implementation and weapon value database
- Agent 2: Basic API client setup and authentication handling
- Agent 3: Overwolf manifest configuration and game event integration

**Phase 2: Core Implementation (Days 4-7)**

- Agent 1: Kill feed analysis and round state tracking
- Agent 2: Steam and Faceit API integration with rate limiting
- Agent 3: Data management architecture and caching systems

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Days 8-11)**

- Agent 1: Economy prediction algorithms and buy pattern analysis
- Agent 2: Leetify integration and Perplexity AI implementation
- Agent 3: Player card UI components and overlay interface

**Phase 4: Integration \& Testing (Days 12-15)**

- Agent 1: Final economy algorithm optimization
- Agent 2: API performance tuning and error handling
- Agent 3: Complete UI assembly, testing, and deployment preparation


## Implementation Specifications

### Economy Tracking Implementation (Agent 1)

Based on current CS2 mechanics[^4][^5][^19], the economy system must account for:

**Round Outcome Rewards**:

- Win bonus: \$3,250 base + \$250 for objective completion
- Loss bonus progression: \$1,400 → \$1,900 → \$2,400 → \$2,900 → \$3,400 (max)
- Bomb plant bonus: \$800 for all terrorists
- Defuse bonus: \$300 for defusing player

**Kill Rewards by Weapon Type**[^6][^20]:

- Rifles/SMGs: \$300 (P90: \$300, other SMGs: \$600)
- Pistols: \$300 (CZ75-Auto: \$100)
- Shotguns: \$900
- AWP: \$100
- Knife: \$1,500

**Weapon Cost Database**[^21][^22]:

- Rifle tier: AK-47 (\$2,700), M4A4/M4A1-S (\$2,900), AWP (\$4,750)
- SMG tier: MAC-10 (\$1,050), MP9 (\$1,250), P90 (\$2,350)
- Pistol tier: P250 (\$300), Deagle (\$700), Five-Seven (\$500)


### API Integration Strategy (Agent 2)

**Steam Web API Integration**[^7][^8]:

```javascript
// Player profile and ban data retrieval
GET /ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/?key={API_KEY}&steamids={STEAM_IDS}
GET /ISteamUser/GetPlayerBans/v1/?key={API_KEY}&steamids={STEAM_IDS}
```

**Faceit API Implementation**[^9][^10]:

- Authentication: Bearer token with server-side API keys
- Endpoints: Player stats, match history, ELO progression
- Rate limiting: Respect 5 requests/second limitation

**Perplexity AI Integration**[^14][^15][^16]:

- Model selection: `sonar-pro` for comprehensive analysis (\$3/million input tokens)
- Structured output: JSON format with cheat probability scoring
- Batch processing: Multiple players per request for cost optimization

**Rate Limiting Strategy**:

- Token bucket algorithm with 5 requests/second global limit
- Intelligent request queuing and prioritization
- Exponential backoff for failed requests
- 24-hour TTL caching to minimize API costs


### System Architecture Implementation (Agent 3)

**Overwolf Manifest Configuration**:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "type": "WebApp",
  "meta": {
    "name": "CS2 Enemy Intelligence",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "data": {
    "game_events": {
      "730": {
        "game_events": ["kill_feed", "match_info"],
        "match_events": ["match_start", "match_end"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Cheat Detection Algorithm**:
Combining traditional statistical analysis with AI assessment[^3][^23]:

- VAC ban history: 40-point weight factor
- Statistical anomalies (headshot percentage >75%): 25-point weight
- Account age factors: 35-point weight for accounts <30 days
- Perplexity AI contextual analysis: 0-100 probability score
- TrackBans integration for additional validation data


## Integration Strategy and Quality Assurance

**Module Integration Points**:

1. **Day 3**: Interface contracts defined between all agents
2. **Day 7**: Agent 1 economy data flows to Agent 3 data manager
3. **Day 9**: Agent 2 API responses integrated with Agent 3 caching layer
4. **Day 13**: Complete system testing and performance optimization

**Performance Requirements**:

- <5% FPS impact during CS2 gameplay
- <2 second initial data load time
- 90%+ accuracy in cheat detection algorithms
- <1% API error rate under normal operation

**Testing Strategy**:

- Unit testing for individual agent components
- Integration testing at defined checkpoint intervals
- Performance testing with simulated CS2 match conditions
- User acceptance testing with overlay responsiveness validation


## Next Steps and Implementation Guide

To begin implementation, follow this structured approach:

1. **Environment Setup** - Install Overwolf developer client and configure development workspace
2. **API Key Acquisition** - Obtain required API keys for Steam, Faceit, Leetify, and Perplexity services
3. **Agent 1 Development** - Begin with economy rules implementation using CS2 weapon database
4. **Agent 2 Development** - Start API client development with proper authentication and rate limiting
5. **Agent 3 Foundation** - Establish Overwolf app structure and game event integration
6. **Iterative Integration** - Follow the defined milestone schedule with regular integration testing

This roadmap provides a comprehensive foundation for building a sophisticated CS2 enemy intelligence application that enhances competitive gameplay through data-driven insights while maintaining VAC compliance and optimal performance.
